- **Occupation Title:** Architects, Except Landscape and Naval
- **Description:** Architects plan and design structures, such as private residences, office buildings, theaters, factories, and other structural property.

### Related O*NET Tasks
1. **Reviewing plans and specifications for compliance with applicable codes.**
   - Architects must ensure that the specifications meet local, state, and federal regulations.
   
2. **Conducting feasibility studies to assess the practicality of a proposed project.**
   - This includes reviewing specifications to confirm that the product callouts are feasible for the project environment.
   
3. **Preparing and presenting design proposals.**
   - Aligning product callouts with design intent to present a coherent building project.
   
4. **Collaborating with engineers and contractors to ensure project is completed according to design specifications.**
   - Ensuring that the specifications are clear and reachable for those involved in execution.

5. **Checking specifications for consistency and accuracy, as well as monitoring for compliance with design documents.**
   - This is particularly relevant for aligning product specifications with design documents.

## Skill Competencies
Here are the essential competencies involved in the construction specification review process. Each competency corresponds to key O*NET skills and tasks to ensure thorough understanding and execution.

### 1. Knowledge of Construction Specifications
   - **Knowledge Area:** Construction Procedures
     - Understand how to read and interpret the CSI 3-part format, including Product, Execution, and Coordination sections.

### 2. Attention to Detail
   - **Skill:** Critical Thinking
     - Analyze specifications line by line to ensure product callouts properly reflect the materials and methods intended for use.

### 3. Technical Writing Skills
   - **Skill:** Writing
     - Document findings and discrepancies clearly in an accessible format for project stakeholders.

### 4. Communication Skills
   - **Skill:** Oral Communication
     - Discuss any inconsistencies found in specifications and product callouts with team members efficiently and effectively.

### 5. Quality Control and Assurance
   - **Skill:** Quality Control Analysis
     - Implement checks to verify that specifications align with the project requirements and intended design, identifying any areas where adjustments are needed.

## Review Process
Follow this checklist when reviewing construction specifications:

1. **Initial Review**
   - Gather all relevant documents, including construction drawings and project scopes.
   - Familiarize yourself with the project's CSI specifications.

2. **Alignment Check**
   - Cross-reference product callouts with the CSI 3-part format.
   - Ensure products specified are suitable for their intended use and compliant with project design standards.

3. **Compliance Verification**
   - Verify compliance with relevant building codes and industry standards.
   - Confirm that materials and products specified are appropriate for the project's location and intended use.

4. **Collaboration and Feedback**
   - Engage with engineers and stakeholders for feedback on product callouts and execution methods.
   - Document any necessary revisions or clarifications directly in the specifications.

5. **Final Review**
   - Perform a secondary review to ensure all comments and revisions have been addressed.
   - Compile a summary of the review, highlighting any changes made to the specifications, and distribute to relevant parties.

## Conclusion
The ability to effectively review construction specifications is a crucial skill for architects and other construction professionals. By understanding the principles outlined in the CSI specification format, ensuring attention to detail, and maintaining communication with stakeholders, professionals can ensure compliance and alignment in their projects, ultimately leading to successful construction outcomes.
